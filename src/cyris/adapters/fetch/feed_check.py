One fetch of the address, through `GuardedHttp`, parsed with feedparser as
`RssSource` parses a feed. A page is not a feed, so a page that names one with
`<link rel="alternate">` is followed once to that feed and parsed in turn. The
feed passes when it has at least one entry, and is named by its own title.
